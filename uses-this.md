## About

I'm a server side software engineer who likes working with others, getting his hands dirty, and getting it done.

## Hardware

At work, I use a 17" MacbookPro with 8GB ram and an SSD. It sits on an mStand and is hooked up to an really nice Dell matte monitor. 
However, macs don't work well with this monitor, so the colors are off and things look a little grainy.
Also, I use a mechanical Das Keyboard and a Logitech g500 mouse. 
I use an iPad to beat people at Scramble with Friends.
My phone is a DroidX that has gotten slower and slower. I'll get an iphone next time.

## Software

Vi and Sublime Text for editing normal text or a copy paste buffer. Definitely want to learn how to use these tools better, especially vim 
for when I'm working in terminal. 
PhpStorm and PyCharm for Php and Python development. I really like the products that JetBrains puts out.
I know it makes me look lame for not using vim for development, but using an IDE for development helps catch a lot of stupid mistakes. 
I've also used and played around with Xcode and Eclipse. I definitely want to do more client side development.
I used to use Firefox until I gave Chrome a chance and found it was so much faster. I'm not sure what the case is now.
Also, I like SequelPro and Charles.

## Dream Setup
I'd like a top of the line 15" Macbook Pro with a matte screen, as much ram as possible, and the largest SSD possible.
