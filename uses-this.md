Software engineer who likes working with others, getting his hands dirty, and getting it done.

## Hardware

At work, I use a 17" MacbookPro with 8GB ram and an SSD. It sits on an mStand and is hooked up to an really nice 27" Dell matte monitor. 
However, macs don't work well with this monitor, or maybe all PC monitors, so the colors are off and things look a little grainy.
Also, I use a mechanical Das Keyboard and a Logitech g500 mouse. I went a while without wearing my AudioTechnica m50s headphones, 
but its definitely good at signalling that you don't want to be disturbed. I just wish the cord wasn't so long. It always gets caught on 
my chair and gets pulled to the ground. 

I use an iPad to beat people at Scramble with Friends.

My phone is a DroidX that has gotten slower and slower. I'll get an iphone next time.

## Software

Vi and Sublime Text for editing normal text or a copy paste buffer. Definitely want to learn how to use these tools better, especially vim 
for when I'm working in terminal. 
PhpStorm and PyCharm for Php and Python development. I really like the products that JetBrains puts out.
I know it makes me look lame for not using vim for development, but using an IDE for development helps catch a lot of stupid mistakes. 
I've also used and played around with Xcode and Eclipse. Working with Eclipse is the bane of my existence. It frequently crashes and the shortcuts are different from
my other IDES.

For bug tracking, we use Asana and Jira. I am the biggest fan of Asana, everything is so snappy and easy to learn. It made me realize how outdated Jira was.

Also, I like SequelPro and Charles.

I used Firefox until I gave Chrome a chance and found it was so much faster. I'm not sure what the case is now.

I like Mint.com for financial tracking and Venmo for mobile payments. Its awesome going to a restaurant with a group and not worrying about splitting the bill. Someone 
takes the bill and everyone else venmo's him/her.

## Dream Setup
I'd like a top of the line 15" Macbook Pro with a matte screen, as much ram as possible, and the largest SSD possible. Also, I'd like for it to be hooked up to two 
large matte screens that actually work correctly with macs.
